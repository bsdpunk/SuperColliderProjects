Vague Threat suggesting you need to be prepard

Too Cool For Scool

Where I am from is hard

You're place ain't shit

everyone's in danger

drugs and alcohol are plentiful

Violence is always present


Relating myself to an agent of the military
I'll come to your house and parry

Suddenly money is all around, causing distress in those I held dear,
now there heads are gone, cause I need to instill fear,
Show my crew, nobody is too close for discipline
They get the message, like branded skin
